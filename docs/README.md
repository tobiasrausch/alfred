# Alfred: BAM Statistics, Feature Counting and Feature Annotation

[Alfred](https://github.com/tobiasrausch/alfred) is an efficient and versatile command-line application that computes multi-sample quality control metrics in a read-group aware manner. Alfred supports read counting, feature annotation and haplotype-resolved consensus computation using multiple sequence alignments. Alfred's [companion web application](https://www.gear-genomics.com/alfred/) enables interactive exploration of results. All code is open-source and hosted on [Alfred's GitHub page](https://github.com/tobiasrausch/alfred).
